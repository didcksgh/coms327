-I've created poke327.c file
Sep 4th

-define the map size
-define xy(x, y) (m->map[y][x]) because it is quite confused to use the original.
-create typdef values
Sep 7th


-created set_boulders method to create boulders in the map
-created set_gate method to set a gate randomly generated. Each gates is n, s, w, e.
-created generate_map method to generate new map.
-created print_map method to print the map and it has randomly picked territories.
-created main method.
Sep 8th

-created build_paths method to find the paths from the gate to the other gate. North to south, and west to east.
-created building_location method to find the right location of the poke center and market.
-created place_pokecenter and place_market method to place the buildings at the location where I've found from the building location.
Sep 9th

-I've found errors. Map isn't generated randomly. It prints out the same map.
-I've corrected the error. Added srand((unsigned int)time(NULL)); to generate random number with the current time.
-I've corrected the error of the terrain generator. Now, it is generate the terrain randomly.
Sep 10th


-I've downloaded the solution code
-define the world_size as 401
-add typedef world
Sep 15th

-I've modified the new map to connect the gate of the neighbor map also allocate the meemory
if there's no world in the current index. In addition, with the given probability,
I've added some if function to place pokemart and pokecenter, level-differently.
Sep 16

-I've created create_world() and delete_world()
-I've modified the main() to get an input from an user and do a required function
by the input. After quiiting game, the world has been deleted so that the next map can be new.
-I've noticed some error in my code, trying to fix it.
Sep 17


-I've downloaded the solution code 1.02
-I've creatd changelog and readme file.

Sep 19

-I've created character_type and modified terrain_type by adding num_terrain_types
-I've created typdef struct pc, and it has a pc position.
-I've implemented the move cost

Sep 20

-I've modified typedef world by adding pc_t pc.
-I've created place_pc() to place pc on the map on the road not the gate randomly.
-I've added if statment in the for loop in the print_map() to print pc's position.('@')
-I've added place_pc in main

Sep 21

-I've copied and modified path_cmp() to hiker_cmp() and raival_cmp() from the solution code provided(1.02).
-To do so, I've added hiker distnace[][] and rival_distance[][] in the typedef world.


-I've create dist_cal() to find and calculate the distance from hiker and rival to pc. 
-To do so, I've modified professor's code from dijkstra_path. Instead, we checked 8-directions of each hiker and rival's position.
-I've added dist_cal on current map in the main.

Sep 28

-I've created print method to print hiker's and rival's distance. print_hiker_distance() and print_rival_distance().
-I've added both print methods in do-while loop in main
-I've noticed pc sometimes is placed on the mountain. I'm working on it to fix it.

Sep 40

-I've fixed the error that pc is not on the right place. I've added place_pc() and dist_cal() inside the do-while loop.
-I've noticed the error that hiker's and rival's distance are same.
-I've fixed the problem.

Oct 1.


-I've downloaded the solution code.
-I've created README and CHANGELOG.

Oct 4.

-define each character's symbol.
-define typdef moovement_type, trainers, and character.
-define MIN_TRAINERS as 8 to make it 10 at least.
-define ADD_TRAINER_PROB as 50 to look like more real game.

Oct 5.

-set static eight_directions[8] for easier use to find the next possible destination in 8-directions.
-create the move_hiker_functiontion() to make a movement fuction of hiker following the instruction.
-create the move_rival_functiontion() to make a movement function of rival following the instruction.

Oct 6.

-I've added rand_dir().
-create the move_pacer_functiontion() to make a movement function of pacer following the instruction.
-create the move_wanderer_functiontion() to make a movement function of wanderer following the instruction.
-create the move_sentry_functiontion() to make a movement function of sentry following the instruction.
-create the move_explorer_functiontion() to make a movement function of explorer following the instruction.
-create the move_pc_function().

Oct 7.

-create random_pos() for the random setting of the position of the character.
-create void new_hiker() to create new hiker.
-create void new_rival() to create new rival.
-create void new_others() to create new others, pacer, wanderer, sentry or explorer. 
-create delete_character().
-modify new_map by adding init_pc(), pathfind() and place_characters().
-create game_loop which is the loop for operating the game.
-modify the main by adding game_loop and delete other parts which operate and print the map.
-got an error due to use the switch to in the gameloop to set an appropriate move_function for each trainers.
-add array of the function pointers, move_function(), probelm is fixed.


Oct 8.

-Download the solution code
-create character.c, chracter.h, input.h, input.c and poke327.h to write the code more efficiently and compactly.
-sorting the corresponding part of the code into character.c and character.h from the original code.

Oct 19th

-in input.c, 
-create input_init_terminal() to initialize the terminal for the pokemon game using ncurses.
  color is also applied in here.
-create input_reset_terminal() to reset the terminal after using ncurses
-create enter_pokemart and enter_pokecenter to print out the message when the pc enter the each building.
-create compare_trainers_distance to calculate the distance from trainers to pc.
-create input_display to display the game world.
-create input_battle to implemnet the battle simply. The npc would be recorded defeated automatically.
-creaet input_trainers_list display() and input_trainers_list().
-create input_scroll_list to implement the scroll up and down of the trainer list. The maximum of 10 trainers would be displayed on a page.
-create move_pc_direction to control the pc's movement. 
-create input_user_input to handle the input from the users.

Oct 20

poke327:
