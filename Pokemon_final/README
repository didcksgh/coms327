I made a simple classic airplane shooting game.
You get to choose the type of airplane you like to play beginning of the game.
After you choose which airplane you like to play with, you can choose the difficulty from easy, medium to hard.
Difficulty is decided based on the enemy airplane's bullets frequency.



Game controls are:

Arrow-up and Arrow-down to move up and down.

'a': shoot bullet.
'q': special move/ultimate.

     Special move/ultimate is following:

     "Skybolt": Shoots bullets in a spread pattern by shooting 5 bullets at once.
     "Thunderbolt": Temporarily increases bullet speed(currently set for five seconds)
     "Fireball": Fires homing bullets that track the enemy.



To run the game:
Makefile will create airplane_battle.exe. ./airplane_battle to run.
